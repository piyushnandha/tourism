        <p>Situated at a mounting height, Pachmarhi, popularly known as 'Satpura ki Rani' (Queen of Satpura) sits
            beautifully amidst the Satpura range. This attractive town was snuggled in the hills and forests until it
            was discovered by Captain James Forsyth in 1857. It is one of the most popular destinations in Madhya
            Pradesh and is a treasure trove of rich history and nature's bounty. The 'Pandavas Caves' in the town is a
            popular attraction which has a fascinating tale. The legend has it that these caves were built by the
            Pandavas who lived here along with their wife Draupadi during their exile. </p>
        <p>Another point of interest is the stone formed JataShankar cave that resembles the hundred-headed divine snake
            Seshnag. As per folklore, it is where Lord Shiva had supposed to have hidden from the Demon Bhasmasur. The
            rocks of this sacred cave looks like the tangled hair of Lord Shiva, hence it is named Jata Shankar.</p>
        <p>From spiritual sites, gushing waterfalls to panoramic vantage points, Pachmarhi has something for everyone.
            Besides scenic beauty, you can enjoy adventure activities like jeep safari in Satpura tiger reserve and
            para-motoring in the heart of Pachmarhi to add more thrill to your trip. If old architectures interests you
            then Christ Church, a true blue building from the colonial era cannot be missed upon! The best time to
            travel to Pachmarhi and see around beautiful places is during monsoon and winter as the beauty of the hill
            station multiplies a thousand folds.</p>
